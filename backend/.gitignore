// Used for ignoring files in git
// This file is used to tell git which files to ignore, and not track in the repository. This is useful for files that are generated by the development environment, or files that are sensitive and should not be shared with others. For example, the node_modules directory is where all of the dependencies for a project are stored. This directory can be very large, and it is not necessary to track it in the repository, as it can be generated by running npm install. By adding node_modules to the .gitignore file, git will ignore this directory and not track it in the repository. This can help keep the repository size small, and make it easier to share and collaborate with others.
